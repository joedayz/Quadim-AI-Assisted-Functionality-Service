    "name": "Vendor Management Strategies",
    "name_en": null,
    "description": "The following strategies enable an approach to working with partners:\n\n    Collaborate closely with the actual people you procure for. Very often the team that requires a product or service to be procured for them will have a very good understanding of good options, and sometimes the best option, available. Listen to them, trust them, and better yet explicitly involve them up-front in the procurement process.\n    Work with the right vendors. Many organizations make the mistake of working with a limited number of vendors, often to simplify procurement. But, if you want the best fit, then you really need to work with a range of vendors. Larger companies tend to offer commodity services and products and are often willing to work with you to gain the specific expertise they are currently missing (this is called “learning on your dime”). Smaller companies are more leading edge but may not have the capacity for larger service engagements or large product orders. Independent contractors are often experts in a specific topic, providing the expert advice or service you require but not at the scale that you may need. \n    Build partnerships. When it comes to procured services, vendor staff will often be a critical part of your value stream. So treat them as such and embed them as closely as you can. Ideally, the integration of full-time employees (FTEs) and contractors should be so good that it’s impossible to identify which company directly employs a given person on a team. Note that some countries, particularly the US, have specific laws that limit how you are able to treat contractors and consultants and may even put an upper limit on how long they may work for you. With respect to purchased products, you may choose to co-develop and even co-produce the offerings with one or more partner firms, sharing the resulting risks and revenues of doing so.\n\nThe following strategies lead to more effective contracting: \n\n    Prefer context-sensitive contracts. The point is that a multimillion-dollar services contract will be a bit more detailed than a contract for two-day workshop. A contract for Agile services should reflect how an agile team works whereas a contract for traditional services should reflect how a traditional team works. Use the right contract for what you are trying to procure – Context counts.\n    Beware the extremes. When it comes to comparing vendors based on cost, which is a questionable strategy at best, our advice is that the vendors in the middle are often your best option. Our experience is that lowest bidder will likely produce low quality or will nickle-and-dime you via their change management strategy whereas the highest bidder either doesn’t want your business to begin with, aren’t streamlined in the way that they work and are thus higher cost, or in some cases really are the very best and know what they’re worth.\n    Prefer flexible funding contracts over fixed-bid contracts. Fixed-bid tends to focus on initial price, thus promoting a lowest-bid mindset which leads to trouble. Systems thinking tells us to end the practice of awarding business based on price tag and instead minimize the total cost (or better yet maximize the net value received). Fixed price contracts tend to be a worst case scenario for all parties involved.\n    Prefer incremental delivery contracts over big-bang contracts. The larger the contract, the greater the risk. To remove that risk, when it's possible, organize a large contract into small incremental deliverables. You reduce the cost of delay by doing so, introduce opportunities for learning and adjusting your strategy, and increase overall transparency (hence improving your ability to govern the contract).\n    Prefer outcome-based contracts over feature-based contracts. Just like your internal metrics should be outcome-focused so should your contracts. There is no guarantee that the features you defined up front will be what customers want, an unfortunate outcome of the traditional “big requirements up front (BRUF)﻿\n\n” strategy. Instead define contracts in terms of outcomes – increased sales, increased customer retention, customer growth, and so on. Effective contracts define a set of outcomes to achieve, a set of constraints, and give the team the freedom to work within that sandbox.\nAvoid detailed contractual processes. Large amounts of up-front planning tend to increase risk in complex situations. Worse yet, detailed contractual processes tend to favor incumbents and large service providers (as opposed to the right vendors), they inhibit transparency (rarely exploring the implications of how a vendor will provide a service), they are inaccurate (everyone tends to be overly optimistic), and they usually ignore outcomes in favor of outputs.\nMonitor fulfillment of contracts. Past performance is critical input into determining whether to award new work to a vendor, which is a significant motivator to act as a good partner right now. Just like regular retrospectives to identify potential improvements works well for solution delivery teams, the same technique can be applied to identify how well a contract is being fulfilled and more importantly how to address any problems you’re currently experiencing.

    "description": "Big data refers to data sets that are too large or complex to be dealt with by traditional data-processing application software. Data with many fields (rows) offer greater statistical power, while data with higher complexity (more attributes or columns) may lead to a higher false discovery rate.[2] Big data analysis challenges include capturing data, data storage, data analysis, search, sharing, transfer, visualization, querying, updating, information privacy, and data source. Big data was originally associated with three key concepts: volume, variety, and velocity.[3] The analysis of big data presents challenges in sampling, and thus previously allowing for only observations and sampling. Thus a fourth concept, veracity, refers to the quality or insightfulness of the data. Without sufficient investment in expertise for big data veracity, then the volume and variety of data can produce costs and risks that exceed an organization's capacity to create and capture value from big data.[4]\n\nCurrent usage of the term big data tends to refer to the use of predictive analytics, user behavior analytics, or certain other advanced data analytics methods that extract value from big data, and seldom to a particular size of data set. \"There is little doubt that the quantities of data now available are indeed large, but that's not the most relevant characteristic of this new data ecosystem.\"[5] Analysis of data sets can find new correlations to \"spot business trends, prevent diseases, combat crime and so on\".[6] Scientists, business executives, medical practitioners, advertising and governments alike regularly meet difficulties with large data-sets in areas including Internet searches, fintech, healthcare analytics, geographic information systems, urban informatics, and business informatics. Scientists encounter limitations in e-Science work, including meteorology, genomics,[7] connectomics, complex physics simulations, biology, and environmental research.[8]\n\nThe size and number of available data sets have grown rapidly as data is collected by devices such as mobile devices, cheap and numerous information-sensing Internet of things devices, aerial (remote sensing), software logs, cameras, microphones, radio-frequency identification (RFID) readers and wireless sensor networks.[9][10] The world's technological per-capita capacity to store information has roughly doubled every 40 months since the 1980s;[11] as of 2012, every day 2.5 exabytes (2.5×260 bytes) of data are generated.[12] Based on an IDC report prediction, the global data volume was predicted to grow exponentially from 4.4 zettabytes to 44 zettabytes between 2013 and 2020. By 2025, IDC predicts there will be 163 zettabytes of data.[13] According to IDC, global spending on big data and business analytics (BDA) solutions is estimated to reach $215.7 billion in 2021.[14][15] While Statista report, the global big data market is forecasted to grow to $103 billion by 2027.[16] In 2011 McKinsey & Company reported, if US healthcare were to use big data creatively and effectively to drive efficiency and quality, the sector could create more than $300 billion in value every year.[17] In the developed economies of Europe, government administrators could save more than €100 billion ($149 billion) in operational efficiency improvements alone by using big data.[17] And users of services enabled by personal-location data could capture $600 billion in consumer surplus.[17] One question for large enterprises is determining who should own big-data initiatives that affect the entire organization.[18]\n\nRelational database management systems and desktop statistical software packages used to visualize data often have difficulty processing and analyzing big data. The processing and analysis of big data may require \"massively parallel software running on tens, hundreds, or even thousands of servers\".[19] What qualifies as \"big data\" varies depending on the capabilities of those analyzing it and their tools. Furthermore, expanding capabilities make big data a moving target. \"For some organizations, facing hundreds of gigabytes of data for the first time may trigger a need to reconsider data management options. For others, it may take tens or hundreds of terabytes before data size becomes a significant consideration.\"",

Google states that[3] \"Android apps can be written using Kotlin, Java, and C++ languages\" using the Android software development kit (SDK), while using other languages is also possible. All non-Java virtual machine (JVM) languages, such as Go, JavaScript, C, C++ or assembly, need the help of JVM language code, that may be supplied by tools, likely with restricted API support. Some programming languages and tools allow cross-platform app support (i.e. for both Android and iOS). Third party tools, development environments, and language support have also continued to evolve and expand since the initial SDK was released in 2008. The official Android app distribution mechanism to end users is Google Play; it also allows staged gradual app release, as well as distribution of pre-release app versions to testers.\n",

Using SQS, you can send, store, and receive messages between software components at any volume, without losing messages or requiring other services to be available. Get started with SQS in minutes using the AWS Management Console, Command Line Interface or SDK of your choice, and three simple commands.\n\nSQS offers two types of message queues. Standard queues offer maximum throughput, best-effort ordering, and at-least-once delivery. SQS FIFO queues are designed to guarantee that messages are processed exactly once, in the exact order that they are sent.\n",

The code, tools, and applications you use today with your existing MySQL and PostgreSQL databases can be used with Aurora. With some workloads, Aurora can deliver up to five times the throughput of MySQL and up to three times the throughput of PostgreSQL without requiring changes to most of your existing applications.\n\nAurora includes a high-performance storage subsystem. Its MySQL- and PostgreSQL-compatible database engines are customized to take advantage of that fast distributed storage. The underlying storage grows automatically as needed. An Aurora cluster volume can grow to a maximum size of 128 tebibytes (TiB). Aurora also automates and standardizes database clustering and replication, which are typically among the most challenging aspects of database configuration and administration.\n\nAurora is part of the managed database service Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS). Amazon RDS is a web service that makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. ",

    "description": "Java agents are a special type of class which, by using the Java Instrumentation API, can intercept applications running on the JVM, modifying their bytecode. Java agents are extremely powerful and also dangerous.\n\nBefore diving in, I will explain how a Java Agent intercepts a Class using the simple HelloWorld Example.\nJava\n\n1\n\npublic class Hello {\n\n2\n\n    public static void main(String[] args){\n\n3\n\n        System.out.println(\"hello world\");\n\n4\n\n    }\n\n5\n\n}\n\n\nAs shown in the below diagram, Classloaders are in charge of loading classes from binary to in-memory. When you run the compiled HelloWorld application (HelloWorld.class), the agent could be viewed as a way to intercept classloaders behavior at runtime. You may think how come the java byte code will be restructured so that agent can add the relevant code at the correct places. The interesting fact is, for Java programs, the structure of the bytecode is really close to the original Java program source code. Hence, while we don’t instrument the Java program itself, we use a very close representation of it. One thing to note is that there are non-Java languages that compile into Java bytecode (such as Scala, Clojure, and Kotlin), which means that the structure and shape of the bytecode for programs can be very different.",

    "description": "OpenEJB was founded by Richard Monson-Haefel and David Blevins in December 1999. At the time there were new vendors moving in the enterprise Java space seemingly every week. Rather than join the space as a competitor, the project was focused entirely on providing these new platforms with a way to quickly get EJB compliance via plugging OpenEJB into their application server.\n\nThe first to integrate OpenEJB in this fashion was Apple's WebObjects in late 2000, released in 2001. When the project moved to Source Forge in 2002 an Apache Tomcat integration was created. Again rather than follow what most in the industry were doing and putting Tomcat into OpenEJB, the project decided to follow its vision and provide an integration that allowed Tomcat users to plug in OpenEJB to gain EJB support in the Tomcat platform. It was in this same vein of putting an EJB container into a Web server that the project developed the Collapsed EAR concept of putting EJBs inside the .war file.\n\nAs part of the work that OpenEJB did to prepare for the integration with Apple's WebObjects, a very large integration test suite was developed. The test suite was developed as a generic application since it would need to be run against both WebObjects and other platforms that integrated OpenEJB. For simplicity in the build the test suite based on JUnit, was run with OpenEJB right inside the tests rather than as a separate process, which was easy to do as the container was designed to be plugged into other platforms and make as little assumptions about its environment as possible. It was from this work that the concept of combining an EJB application with plain unit tests and an embeddable EJB container was born. Originally referred to as a \"local\" EJB container and what lead the project to describe itself as being able to run in two modes: Local and Remote.\n\nIn August 2003 the project helped launch the Apache Geronimo application server. Originally a new version of OpenEJB was developed ground up based on Geronimo's GBean architecture and released as OpenEJB 2.0 which lived throughout the Geronimo 1.x cycle. In 2006 when EJB 3.0 was released which had a focus on simplicity, the project went back to its roots and revived the OpenEJB 1.0 codebase, ported select bits of the 2.0 codebase, and eventually brought it up to the EJB 3.0 spec level in what is now called OpenEJB 3.0.

    "description": " In software engineering, service-oriented architecture (SOA) is an architectural style that focuses on discrete services instead of a monolithic design.[1] By consequence, it is as well applied in the field of software design where services are provided to the other components by application components, through a communication protocol over a network. A service is a discrete unit of functionality that can be accessed remotely and acted upon and updated independently, such as retrieving a credit card statement online. SOA is also intended to be independent of vendors, products and technologies.[2]\n\nService orientation is a way of thinking in terms of services and service-based development and the outcomes of services.[1]\n\nA service has four properties according to one of many definitions of SOA:[3]\n\n    It logically represents a repeatable business activity with a specified outcome.\n    It is self-contained.\n    It is a black box for its consumers, meaning the consumer does not have to be aware of the service's inner workings.\n    It may be composed of other services.[4]\n\nDifferent services can be used in conjunction as a service mesh to provide the functionality of a large software application,[5] a principle SOA shares with modular programming. Service-oriented architecture integrates distributed, separately maintained and deployed software components. It is enabled by technologies and standards that facilitate components' communication and cooperation over a network, especially over an IP network.\n\nSOA is related to the idea of an API (application programming interface), an interface or communication protocol between different parts of a computer program intended to simplify the implementation and maintenance of software. An API can be thought of as the service, and the SOA the architecture that allows the service to operate. ",

    "description": "Single sign-on (SSO) is an authentication scheme that allows a user to log in with a single ID to any of several related, yet independent, software systems.\n\nTrue single sign-on allows the user to log in once and access services without re-entering authentication factors.\n\nIt should not be confused with same-sign on (Directory Server Authentication), often accomplished by using the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) and stored LDAP databases on (directory) servers.[1][2]\n\nA simple version of single sign-on can be achieved over IP networks using cookies but only if the sites share a common DNS parent domain.[3]\n\nFor clarity, a distinction is made between Directory Server Authentication (same-sign on) and single sign-on: Directory Server Authentication refers to systems requiring authentication for each application but using the same credentials from a directory server, whereas single sign-on refers to systems where a single authentication provides access to multiple applications by passing the authentication token seamlessly to configured applications.\n\nConversely, single sign-off or single log-out (SLO) is the property whereby a single action of signing out terminates access to multiple software systems.\n\nAs different applications and resources support different authentication mechanisms, single sign-on must internally store the credentials used for initial authentication and translate them to the credentials required for the different mechanisms.\n\nOther shared authentication schemes, such as OpenID and OpenID Connect, offer other services that may require users to make choices during a sign-on to a resource, but can be configured for single sign-on if those other services (such as user consent) are disabled.[4] An increasing number of federated social logons, like Facebook Connect, do require the user to enter consent choices upon first registration with a new resource, and so are not always single sign-on in the strictest sense.

    "description": "Hazelcast is a distributed computation and storage platform for consistently low-latency querying, aggregation and stateful computation against event streams and traditional data sources. It allows you to quickly build resource-efficient, real-time applications. You can deploy it at any scale from small edge devices to a large cluster of cloud instances.\n\nHazelcast can process data on a set of networked and clustered computers that pool together their random access memories (RAM) to let applications share data with other applications running in the cluster. When data is stored in RAM, applications run a lot faster since it does not need to be retrieved from disk and put into RAM prior to processing. Using Hazelcast, you can store and process your data in RAM, spread and replicate it across a cluster of machines; replication gives you resilience to failures of cluster members.\n\nHazelcast is implemented in Java language and has clients for Java, C++, .NET, REST, Python, Go and Node.js. Hazelcast also speaks Memcached and REST protocols.\n\nYour cloud-native applications can easily use Hazelcast. It is flexible enough to use as a data and computing platform out-of-the-box or as a framework for your own cloud-native applications and microservices.\n\nHazelcast is designed to be lightweight and easy to use. Since it is delivered as a compact library, it easily plugs into your software solution.\n\nIt is designed to scale up to hundreds of members and thousands of clients. When you add new members, they automatically discover the cluster and linearly increase both the memory and processing capacity. The members maintain a TCP connection between each other and all communication is performed through this layer. Each cluster member is configured to be the same in terms of functionality. The oldest member (the first member created in the cluster) automatically performs the stored and streaming data assignment to cluster members. If the oldest member dies, the second oldest member takes over.\n\nHazelcast offers simple scalability, partitioning (sharding), and re-balancing out-of-the-box. It does not require any extra coordination processes. NoSQL and traditional databases are difficult to scale out and manage. They require additional processes for coordination and high availability. With Hazelcast, when you start another process to add more capacity, data and backups are automatically and evenly balanced.\n",

The protocol defines the rules, syntax, semantics and synchronization of communication and possible error recovery methods. Protocols may be implemented by hardware, software, or a combination of both.[1]\n\nCommunicating systems use well-defined formats for exchanging various messages. Each message has an exact meaning intended to elicit a response from a range of possible responses pre-determined for that particular situation. The specified behavior is typically independent of how it is to be implemented. Communication protocols have to be agreed upon by the parties involved. To reach an agreement, a protocol may be developed into a technical standard. A programming language describes the same for computations, so there is a close analogy between protocols and programming languages: protocols are to communication what programming languages are to computations. An alternate formulation states that protocols are to communication what algorithms are to computation. ",

    "description": " A microservice architecture – a variant of the SOA (service-oriented architecture) structural style – arranges an application as a collection of loosely-coupled services. In a microservice architecture, services are fine-grained and the protocols are lightweight. The goal is that teams can bring their services to life independent of others. Loose coupling reduces all types of dependencies and the complexities around it, as service developers do not need to care about the users of the service, they do not force their changes onto users of the service.[1][clarification needed] Therefore it allows organizations developing software to grow fast and big, as well as use off-the-shelf services more easily. Communication requirements are reduced. These benefits come at a cost to maintaining the decoupling. Interfaces need to be designed carefully and treated as a public API. One technique that is used is having multiple interfaces on the same service, or multiple versions of the same service, so as to not disrupt existing users of the code. ",

It was developed at Rational Software in 1994–1995, with further development led by them through 1996.\n\nIn 1997, UML was adopted as a standard by the Object Management Group (OMG), and has been managed by this organization ever since. In 2005, UML was also published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) as an approved ISO standard. Since then the standard has been periodically revised to cover the latest revision of UML. In software engineering, most practitioners do not use UML, but instead produce informal hand drawn diagrams; these diagrams, however, often include elements from UML.",

You can additionally create custom dashboards to display metrics about your custom applications, and display custom collections of metrics that you choose.\n\nYou can create alarms that watch metrics and send notifications or automatically make changes to the resources you are monitoring when a threshold is breached. For example, you can monitor the CPU usage and disk reads and writes of your Amazon EC2 instances and then use that data to determine whether you should launch additional instances to handle increased load. You can also use this data to stop under-used instances to save money.\n\nWith CloudWatch, you gain system-wide visibility into resource utilization, application performance, and operational health.",

    "description": "Azure is Microsoft's public cloud platform. Azure offers a large collection of services, which includes platform as a service (PaaS), infrastructure as a service (IaaS), and managed database service capabilities. However, what exactly is Azure, and how does it work?\n\nAzure, like other cloud platforms, relies on a technology known as virtualization. Most computer hardware can be emulated in software. Computer hardware is simply a set of instructions, which are permanently, or semi-permanently, encoded in silicon. Emulation layers are used to map software instructions to hardware instructions. Emulation layers allow virtualized hardware to execute in software like the actual hardware itself.\n\nEssentially, the cloud is a set of physical servers in one or more datacenters. The datacenters execute virtualized hardware for customers. So how does the cloud create, start, stop, and delete millions of instances of virtualized hardware for millions of customers simultaneously?\n\nTo understand the servers, let's look at the architecture of hardware in the datacenter. Inside each datacenter, there's a collection of servers sitting in server racks. Each server rack contains many server blades, and a network switch. These provide network connectivity and a power distribution unit (PDU), which creates power. Racks are sometimes grouped together in larger units known as clusters.\n\nThe server racks, or clusters, are chosen to run virtualized hardware instances for the user. However, some servers run cloud management software, known as a fabric controller. The fabric controller is a distributed application with many responsibilities. It allocates services, monitors the health of the server and the services running on it, and heals servers when they fail.\n\nEach instance of the fabric controller is connected to another set of servers running cloud orchestration software, typically known as the front end. The front end hosts the web services, RESTful APIs, and internal Azure databases, which are used for all functions in the cloud.\n\nFor example, the front end hosts the services that handle customer requests. The requests allocate Azure resources and services such as virtual machines, and Azure Cosmos DB. First, the front end validates and verifies if the user is authorized to allocate the requested resources. If so, the front end checks a database to locate a server rack with sufficient capacity, which instructs the fabric controller to allocate the resource.\n\nAzure is a huge collection of servers and networking hardware, which runs a complex set of distributed applications. These applications orchestrate the configuration and operation of virtualized hardware and software on those servers. The orchestration of these servers is what makes Azure so powerful. With Azure, users don't have to maintain and upgrade their hardware as Azure does this behind the scenes.",

In the defense sector, it is the dominant approach to managing large projects. Because major defense programs entail working with contractors, it is also called acquisition management, indicating that the government buyer acquires goods and services by means of contractors.\n\nThe program manager has oversight of the purpose and status of the projects in a program and can use this oversight to support project-level activity to ensure the program goals are met by providing a decision-making capacity that cannot be achieved at project level or by providing the project manager with a program perspective when required, or as a sounding board for ideas and approaches to solving project issues that have program impacts. The program manager may be well-placed to provide this insight by actively seeking out such information from the project managers, although in large and/or complex projects, a specific role may be required. However this insight arises, the program manager needs this in order to be comfortable that the overall program goals are achievable.",

    "description": "Dyrke selv\nDet er ikke vanskelig å dyrke chili selv. Den største utfordringen er at den har en lang vekstsesong og krever mye lys og bra med varme for å kunne utvikle frukt.  I Norge er det derfor mest optimalt å dyrke chili i drivhus eller innendørs. Skal en rekke å få fram bra avling av frukt i løpet av en vekstsesong, må en forkultivere inne og helst så i løpet av månedene januar og februar.  Dette medfører også behov for kunstig lys.  Hvilken lyskilde du bør bruke er avhengig av hvor mange planter du skal dyrke og hvor mye penger en vil bruke. Det billigste vil ofte være å bruke lysarmatur med såkalt T5 lysrør. Disse finnes i mange forskjellige størrelser og utforminger som kan tilpasses ditt be",

Aside from the raw analysis step, it also involves database and data management aspects, data pre-processing, model and inference considerations, interestingness metrics, complexity considerations, post-processing of discovered structures, visualization, and online updating",

    "name": "Vendor Management Strategies",
    "name_en": null,
    "description": "The following strategies enable an approach to working with partners:\n\n    Collaborate closely with the actual people you procure for. Very often the team that requires a product or service to be procured for them will have a very good understanding of good options, and sometimes the best option, available. Listen to them, trust them, and better yet explicitly involve them up-front in the procurement process.\n    Work with the right vendors. Many organizations make the mistake of working with a limited number of vendors, often to simplify procurement. But, if you want the best fit, then you really need to work with a range of vendors. Larger companies tend to offer commodity services and products and are often willing to work with you to gain the specific expertise they are currently missing (this is called “learning on your dime”). Smaller companies are more leading edge but may not have the capacity for larger service engagements or large product orders. Independent contractors are often experts in a specific topic, providing the expert advice or service you require but not at the scale that you may need. \n    Build partnerships. When it comes to procured services, vendor staff will often be a critical part of your value stream. So treat them as such and embed them as closely as you can. Ideally, the integration of full-time employees (FTEs) and contractors should be so good that it’s impossible to identify which company directly employs a given person on a team. Note that some countries, particularly the US, have specific laws that limit how you are able to treat contractors and consultants and may even put an upper limit on how long they may work for you. With respect to purchased products, you may choose to co-develop and even co-produce the offerings with one or more partner firms, sharing the resulting risks and revenues of doing so.\n\nThe following strategies lead to more effective contracting: \n\n    Prefer context-sensitive contracts. The point is that a multimillion-dollar services contract will be a bit more detailed than a contract for two-day workshop. A contract for Agile services should reflect how an agile team works whereas a contract for traditional services should reflect how a traditional team works. Use the right contract for what you are trying to procure – Context counts.\n    Beware the extremes. When it comes to comparing vendors based on cost, which is a questionable strategy at best, our advice is that the vendors in the middle are often your best option. Our experience is that lowest bidder will likely produce low quality or will nickle-and-dime you via their change management strategy whereas the highest bidder either doesn’t want your business to begin with, aren’t streamlined in the way that they work and are thus higher cost, or in some cases really are the very best and know what they’re worth.\n    Prefer flexible funding contracts over fixed-bid contracts. Fixed-bid tends to focus on initial price, thus promoting a lowest-bid mindset which leads to trouble. Systems thinking tells us to end the practice of awarding business based on price tag and instead minimize the total cost (or better yet maximize the net value received). Fixed price contracts tend to be a worst case scenario for all parties involved.\n    Prefer incremental delivery contracts over big-bang contracts. The larger the contract, the greater the risk. To remove that risk, when it's possible, organize a large contract into small incremental deliverables. You reduce the cost of delay by doing so, introduce opportunities for learning and adjusting your strategy, and increase overall transparency (hence improving your ability to govern the contract).\n    Prefer outcome-based contracts over feature-based contracts. Just like your internal metrics should be outcome-focused so should your contracts. There is no guarantee that the features you defined up front will be what customers want, an unfortunate outcome of the traditional “big requirements up front (BRUF)﻿\n\n” strategy. Instead define contracts in terms of outcomes – increased sales, increased customer retention, customer growth, and so on. Effective contracts define a set of outcomes to achieve, a set of constraints, and give the team the freedom to work within that sandbox.\nAvoid detailed contractual processes. Large amounts of up-front planning tend to increase risk in complex situations. Worse yet, detailed contractual processes tend to favor incumbents and large service providers (as opposed to the right vendors), they inhibit transparency (rarely exploring the implications of how a vendor will provide a service), they are inaccurate (everyone tends to be overly optimistic), and they usually ignore outcomes in favor of outputs.\nMonitor fulfillment of contracts. Past performance is critical input into determining whether to award new work to a vendor, which is a significant motivator to act as a good partner right now. Just like regular retrospectives to identify potential improvements works well for solution delivery teams, the same technique can be applied to identify how well a contract is being fulfilled and more importantly how to address any problems you’re currently experiencing.

    "description": "Big data refers to data sets that are too large or complex to be dealt with by traditional data-processing application software. Data with many fields (rows) offer greater statistical power, while data with higher complexity (more attributes or columns) may lead to a higher false discovery rate.[2] Big data analysis challenges include capturing data, data storage, data analysis, search, sharing, transfer, visualization, querying, updating, information privacy, and data source. Big data was originally associated with three key concepts: volume, variety, and velocity.[3] The analysis of big data presents challenges in sampling, and thus previously allowing for only observations and sampling. Thus a fourth concept, veracity, refers to the quality or insightfulness of the data. Without sufficient investment in expertise for big data veracity, then the volume and variety of data can produce costs and risks that exceed an organization's capacity to create and capture value from big data.[4]\n\nCurrent usage of the term big data tends to refer to the use of predictive analytics, user behavior analytics, or certain other advanced data analytics methods that extract value from big data, and seldom to a particular size of data set. \"There is little doubt that the quantities of data now available are indeed large, but that's not the most relevant characteristic of this new data ecosystem.\"[5] Analysis of data sets can find new correlations to \"spot business trends, prevent diseases, combat crime and so on\".[6] Scientists, business executives, medical practitioners, advertising and governments alike regularly meet difficulties with large data-sets in areas including Internet searches, fintech, healthcare analytics, geographic information systems, urban informatics, and business informatics. Scientists encounter limitations in e-Science work, including meteorology, genomics,[7] connectomics, complex physics simulations, biology, and environmental research.[8]\n\nThe size and number of available data sets have grown rapidly as data is collected by devices such as mobile devices, cheap and numerous information-sensing Internet of things devices, aerial (remote sensing), software logs, cameras, microphones, radio-frequency identification (RFID) readers and wireless sensor networks.[9][10] The world's technological per-capita capacity to store information has roughly doubled every 40 months since the 1980s;[11] as of 2012, every day 2.5 exabytes (2.5×260 bytes) of data are generated.[12] Based on an IDC report prediction, the global data volume was predicted to grow exponentially from 4.4 zettabytes to 44 zettabytes between 2013 and 2020. By 2025, IDC predicts there will be 163 zettabytes of data.[13] According to IDC, global spending on big data and business analytics (BDA) solutions is estimated to reach $215.7 billion in 2021.[14][15] While Statista report, the global big data market is forecasted to grow to $103 billion by 2027.[16] In 2011 McKinsey & Company reported, if US healthcare were to use big data creatively and effectively to drive efficiency and quality, the sector could create more than $300 billion in value every year.[17] In the developed economies of Europe, government administrators could save more than €100 billion ($149 billion) in operational efficiency improvements alone by using big data.[17] And users of services enabled by personal-location data could capture $600 billion in consumer surplus.[17] One question for large enterprises is determining who should own big-data initiatives that affect the entire organization.[18]\n\nRelational database management systems and desktop statistical software packages used to visualize data often have difficulty processing and analyzing big data. The processing and analysis of big data may require \"massively parallel software running on tens, hundreds, or even thousands of servers\".[19] What qualifies as \"big data\" varies depending on the capabilities of those analyzing it and their tools. Furthermore, expanding capabilities make big data a moving target. \"For some organizations, facing hundreds of gigabytes of data for the first time may trigger a need to reconsider data management options. For others, it may take tens or hundreds of terabytes before data size becomes a significant consideration.\"",

Google states that[3] \"Android apps can be written using Kotlin, Java, and C++ languages\" using the Android software development kit (SDK), while using other languages is also possible. All non-Java virtual machine (JVM) languages, such as Go, JavaScript, C, C++ or assembly, need the help of JVM language code, that may be supplied by tools, likely with restricted API support. Some programming languages and tools allow cross-platform app support (i.e. for both Android and iOS). Third party tools, development environments, and language support have also continued to evolve and expand since the initial SDK was released in 2008. The official Android app distribution mechanism to end users is Google Play; it also allows staged gradual app release, as well as distribution of pre-release app versions to testers.\n",

The code, tools, and applications you use today with your existing MySQL and PostgreSQL databases can be used with Aurora. With some workloads, Aurora can deliver up to five times the throughput of MySQL and up to three times the throughput of PostgreSQL without requiring changes to most of your existing applications.\n\nAurora includes a high-performance storage subsystem. Its MySQL- and PostgreSQL-compatible database engines are customized to take advantage of that fast distributed storage. The underlying storage grows automatically as needed. An Aurora cluster volume can grow to a maximum size of 128 tebibytes (TiB). Aurora also automates and standardizes database clustering and replication, which are typically among the most challenging aspects of database configuration and administration.\n\nAurora is part of the managed database service Amazon Relational Database Service (Amazon RDS). Amazon RDS is a web service that makes it easier to set up, operate, and scale a relational database in the cloud. ",

    "description": "Java agents are a special type of class which, by using the Java Instrumentation API, can intercept applications running on the JVM, modifying their bytecode. Java agents are extremely powerful and also dangerous.\n\nBefore diving in, I will explain how a Java Agent intercepts a Class using the simple HelloWorld Example.\nJava\n\n1\n\npublic class Hello {\n\n2\n\n    public static void main(String[] args){\n\n3\n\n        System.out.println(\"hello world\");\n\n4\n\n    }\n\n5\n\n}\n\n\nAs shown in the below diagram, Classloaders are in charge of loading classes from binary to in-memory. When you run the compiled HelloWorld application (HelloWorld.class), the agent could be viewed as a way to intercept classloaders behavior at runtime. You may think how come the java byte code will be restructured so that agent can add the relevant code at the correct places. The interesting fact is, for Java programs, the structure of the bytecode is really close to the original Java program source code. Hence, while we don’t instrument the Java program itself, we use a very close representation of it. One thing to note is that there are non-Java languages that compile into Java bytecode (such as Scala, Clojure, and Kotlin), which means that the structure and shape of the bytecode for programs can be very different.",

    "description": "OpenEJB was founded by Richard Monson-Haefel and David Blevins in December 1999. At the time there were new vendors moving in the enterprise Java space seemingly every week. Rather than join the space as a competitor, the project was focused entirely on providing these new platforms with a way to quickly get EJB compliance via plugging OpenEJB into their application server.\n\nThe first to integrate OpenEJB in this fashion was Apple's WebObjects in late 2000, released in 2001. When the project moved to Source Forge in 2002 an Apache Tomcat integration was created. Again rather than follow what most in the industry were doing and putting Tomcat into OpenEJB, the project decided to follow its vision and provide an integration that allowed Tomcat users to plug in OpenEJB to gain EJB support in the Tomcat platform. It was in this same vein of putting an EJB container into a Web server that the project developed the Collapsed EAR concept of putting EJBs inside the .war file.\n\nAs part of the work that OpenEJB did to prepare for the integration with Apple's WebObjects, a very large integration test suite was developed. The test suite was developed as a generic application since it would need to be run against both WebObjects and other platforms that integrated OpenEJB. For simplicity in the build the test suite based on JUnit, was run with OpenEJB right inside the tests rather than as a separate process, which was easy to do as the container was designed to be plugged into other platforms and make as little assumptions about its environment as possible. It was from this work that the concept of combining an EJB application with plain unit tests and an embeddable EJB container was born. Originally referred to as a \"local\" EJB container and what lead the project to describe itself as being able to run in two modes: Local and Remote.\n\nIn August 2003 the project helped launch the Apache Geronimo application server. Originally a new version of OpenEJB was developed ground up based on Geronimo's GBean architecture and released as OpenEJB 2.0 which lived throughout the Geronimo 1.x cycle. In 2006 when EJB 3.0 was released which had a focus on simplicity, the project went back to its roots and revived the OpenEJB 1.0 codebase, ported select bits of the 2.0 codebase, and eventually brought it up to the EJB 3.0 spec level in what is now called OpenEJB 3.0.

    "description": " In software engineering, service-oriented architecture (SOA) is an architectural style that focuses on discrete services instead of a monolithic design.[1] By consequence, it is as well applied in the field of software design where services are provided to the other components by application components, through a communication protocol over a network. A service is a discrete unit of functionality that can be accessed remotely and acted upon and updated independently, such as retrieving a credit card statement online. SOA is also intended to be independent of vendors, products and technologies.[2]\n\nService orientation is a way of thinking in terms of services and service-based development and the outcomes of services.[1]\n\nA service has four properties according to one of many definitions of SOA:[3]\n\n    It logically represents a repeatable business activity with a specified outcome.\n    It is self-contained.\n    It is a black box for its consumers, meaning the consumer does not have to be aware of the service's inner workings.\n    It may be composed of other services.[4]\n\nDifferent services can be used in conjunction as a service mesh to provide the functionality of a large software application,[5] a principle SOA shares with modular programming. Service-oriented architecture integrates distributed, separately maintained and deployed software components. It is enabled by technologies and standards that facilitate components' communication and cooperation over a network, especially over an IP network.\n\nSOA is related to the idea of an API (application programming interface), an interface or communication protocol between different parts of a computer program intended to simplify the implementation and maintenance of software. An API can be thought of as the service, and the SOA the architecture that allows the service to operate. ",

    "description": "Single sign-on (SSO) is an authentication scheme that allows a user to log in with a single ID to any of several related, yet independent, software systems.\n\nTrue single sign-on allows the user to log in once and access services without re-entering authentication factors.\n\nIt should not be confused with same-sign on (Directory Server Authentication), often accomplished by using the Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) and stored LDAP databases on (directory) servers.[1][2]\n\nA simple version of single sign-on can be achieved over IP networks using cookies but only if the sites share a common DNS parent domain.[3]\n\nFor clarity, a distinction is made between Directory Server Authentication (same-sign on) and single sign-on: Directory Server Authentication refers to systems requiring authentication for each application but using the same credentials from a directory server, whereas single sign-on refers to systems where a single authentication provides access to multiple applications by passing the authentication token seamlessly to configured applications.\n\nConversely, single sign-off or single log-out (SLO) is the property whereby a single action of signing out terminates access to multiple software systems.\n\nAs different applications and resources support different authentication mechanisms, single sign-on must internally store the credentials used for initial authentication and translate them to the credentials required for the different mechanisms.\n\nOther shared authentication schemes, such as OpenID and OpenID Connect, offer other services that may require users to make choices during a sign-on to a resource, but can be configured for single sign-on if those other services (such as user consent) are disabled.[4] An increasing number of federated social logons, like Facebook Connect, do require the user to enter consent choices upon first registration with a new resource, and so are not always single sign-on in the strictest sense.

    "description": "Hazelcast is a distributed computation and storage platform for consistently low-latency querying, aggregation and stateful computation against event streams and traditional data sources. It allows you to quickly build resource-efficient, real-time applications. You can deploy it at any scale from small edge devices to a large cluster of cloud instances.\n\nHazelcast can process data on a set of networked and clustered computers that pool together their random access memories (RAM) to let applications share data with other applications running in the cluster. When data is stored in RAM, applications run a lot faster since it does not need to be retrieved from disk and put into RAM prior to processing. Using Hazelcast, you can store and process your data in RAM, spread and replicate it across a cluster of machines; replication gives you resilience to failures of cluster members.\n\nHazelcast is implemented in Java language and has clients for Java, C++, .NET, REST, Python, Go and Node.js. Hazelcast also speaks Memcached and REST protocols.\n\nYour cloud-native applications can easily use Hazelcast. It is flexible enough to use as a data and computing platform out-of-the-box or as a framework for your own cloud-native applications and microservices.\n\nHazelcast is designed to be lightweight and easy to use. Since it is delivered as a compact library, it easily plugs into your software solution.\n\nIt is designed to scale up to hundreds of members and thousands of clients. When you add new members, they automatically discover the cluster and linearly increase both the memory and processing capacity. The members maintain a TCP connection between each other and all communication is performed through this layer. Each cluster member is configured to be the same in terms of functionality. The oldest member (the first member created in the cluster) automatically performs the stored and streaming data assignment to cluster members. If the oldest member dies, the second oldest member takes over.\n\nHazelcast offers simple scalability, partitioning (sharding), and re-balancing out-of-the-box. It does not require any extra coordination processes. NoSQL and traditional databases are difficult to scale out and manage. They require additional processes for coordination and high availability. With Hazelcast, when you start another process to add more capacity, data and backups are automatically and evenly balanced.\n",

The protocol defines the rules, syntax, semantics and synchronization of communication and possible error recovery methods. Protocols may be implemented by hardware, software, or a combination of both.[1]\n\nCommunicating systems use well-defined formats for exchanging various messages. Each message has an exact meaning intended to elicit a response from a range of possible responses pre-determined for that particular situation. The specified behavior is typically independent of how it is to be implemented. Communication protocols have to be agreed upon by the parties involved. To reach an agreement, a protocol may be developed into a technical standard. A programming language describes the same for computations, so there is a close analogy between protocols and programming languages: protocols are to communication what programming languages are to computations. An alternate formulation states that protocols are to communication what algorithms are to computation. ",

    "description": " A microservice architecture – a variant of the SOA (service-oriented architecture) structural style – arranges an application as a collection of loosely-coupled services. In a microservice architecture, services are fine-grained and the protocols are lightweight. The goal is that teams can bring their services to life independent of others. Loose coupling reduces all types of dependencies and the complexities around it, as service developers do not need to care about the users of the service, they do not force their changes onto users of the service.[1][clarification needed] Therefore it allows organizations developing software to grow fast and big, as well as use off-the-shelf services more easily. Communication requirements are reduced. These benefits come at a cost to maintaining the decoupling. Interfaces need to be designed carefully and treated as a public API. One technique that is used is having multiple interfaces on the same service, or multiple versions of the same service, so as to not disrupt existing users of the code. ",

It was developed at Rational Software in 1994–1995, with further development led by them through 1996.\n\nIn 1997, UML was adopted as a standard by the Object Management Group (OMG), and has been managed by this organization ever since. In 2005, UML was also published by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) as an approved ISO standard. Since then the standard has been periodically revised to cover the latest revision of UML. In software engineering, most practitioners do not use UML, but instead produce informal hand drawn diagrams; these diagrams, however, often include elements from UML.",

For example, you can monitor the CPU usage and disk reads and writes of your Amazon EC2 instances and then use that data to determine whether you should launch additional instances to handle increased load. You can also use this data to stop under-used instances to save money.\n\nWith CloudWatch, you gain system-wide visibility into resource utilization, application performance, and operational health.",

    "description": "Azure is Microsoft's public cloud platform. Azure offers a large collection of services, which includes platform as a service (PaaS), infrastructure as a service (IaaS), and managed database service capabilities. However, what exactly is Azure, and how does it work?\n\nAzure, like other cloud platforms, relies on a technology known as virtualization. Most computer hardware can be emulated in software. Computer hardware is simply a set of instructions, which are permanently, or semi-permanently, encoded in silicon. Emulation layers are used to map software instructions to hardware instructions. Emulation layers allow virtualized hardware to execute in software like the actual hardware itself.\n\nEssentially, the cloud is a set of physical servers in one or more datacenters. The datacenters execute virtualized hardware for customers. So how does the cloud create, start, stop, and delete millions of instances of virtualized hardware for millions of customers simultaneously?\n\nTo understand the servers, let's look at the architecture of hardware in the datacenter. Inside each datacenter, there's a collection of servers sitting in server racks. Each server rack contains many server blades, and a network switch. These provide network connectivity and a power distribution unit (PDU), which creates power. Racks are sometimes grouped together in larger units known as clusters.\n\nThe server racks, or clusters, are chosen to run virtualized hardware instances for the user. However, some servers run cloud management software, known as a fabric controller. The fabric controller is a distributed application with many responsibilities. It allocates services, monitors the health of the server and the services running on it, and heals servers when they fail.\n\nEach instance of the fabric controller is connected to another set of servers running cloud orchestration software, typically known as the front end. The front end hosts the web services, RESTful APIs, and internal Azure databases, which are used for all functions in the cloud.\n\nFor example, the front end hosts the services that handle customer requests. The requests allocate Azure resources and services such as virtual machines, and Azure Cosmos DB. First, the front end validates and verifies if the user is authorized to allocate the requested resources. If so, the front end checks a database to locate a server rack with sufficient capacity, which instructs the fabric controller to allocate the resource.\n\nAzure is a huge collection of servers and networking hardware, which runs a complex set of distributed applications. These applications orchestrate the configuration and operation of virtualized hardware and software on those servers. The orchestration of these servers is what makes Azure so powerful. With Azure, users don't have to maintain and upgrade their hardware as Azure does this behind the scenes.",

I Norge er det derfor mest optimalt å dyrke chili i drivhus eller innendørs. Skal en rekke å få fram bra avling av frukt i løpet av en vekstsesong, må en forkultivere inne og helst så i løpet av månedene januar og februar.  Dette medfører også behov for kunstig lys.  Hvilken lyskilde du bør bruke er avhengig av hvor mange planter du skal dyrke og hvor mye penger en vil bruke. Det billigste vil ofte være å bruke lysarmatur med såkalt T5 lysrør. Disse finnes i mange forskjellige størrelser og utforminger som kan tilpasses ditt be",
